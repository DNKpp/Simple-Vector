## Description
This library provides an implementation of a simple to use but versatile mathematically vector class. Due to the usage of lots of c++20 features, this library currently doesn't compile without errors on some compilers. Look at the table above to get an idea about, which compiler is able to compile the library tests.

One of the main intentions behind this vector implementation is being able to do as much during compile-time as possible, thus all functions are declared as constexpr.

## Example
```cpp
/* With inclusion of this header, everything of the library will be available.*/
#include <Simple-Vector/Simple-Vector.hpp>

#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>

int main()
{
	// make the Vector class locally available with less verbosity 
	using sl::vec::Vector;
	
	Vector<int, 2> intVec1;			// this will default construct all elements to 0
	intVec1 += 2;					// adds 2 to each element
	
	Vector<int, 2> intVec2{ 1, 3 }; // constructs a new vector with x == 1 and y == 3

	Vector difference = static_cast<Vector<float, 2>>(intVec1 - intVec2);	// binary vector + and - arithmetic is possible as well as casting to vectors with other value types
	auto distance = length(difference);										// length is a free function, which is luckily available due to ADL even if it sits in the sl::vec namespace
	
	auto tmp = difference.x();					// each vector has a .x() member function, which returns a ref to the first element
	tmp = difference.y();						// vectors with two or more dimensions also have a y.() function; lastly vectors with three or more dimensions have a .z() function
	tmp = difference[0];						// but users may also access the elements via operator []

	for (auto el : difference)					// or simply iterate over each element
	{
		std::cout << el << " ";
	}
	std::cout << std::endl;

	for (auto el : intVec2 | std::views::take(1)) // vectors are also fully compatible to the new ranges or the older stl algorithms
	{
		std::cout << el;
	}
	
	Vector doubles{ 42. };		// this will be deduced to Vector<double, 1>
	auto doubles2 = static_cast<Vector<double, 3>>(doubles);		// casting between different dimensions is also possible
}
```

## Installation with CMake
This library can easily be integrated into your project via CMake target_link_libraries command.

```cmake
target_link_libraries(
	<your_target_name>
	PRIVATE
	Simple_Vector
)
```
This will add the the include path "<simple_vector_install_dir>/include", thus you are able to include the headers via
```cpp
#include <Simple-Vector/Simple-Vector.hpp>
```

### FetchContent
It is possible fetching this library via CMakes FetchContent module.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14 FATAL_ERROR)

project(<your_project_name>)

include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
	Simple_Vector
	GIT_REPOSITORY	https://github.com/DNKpp/Simple-Vector
	GIT_TAG		origin/v1.x
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(Simple_Vector)

target_link_libraries(
	<your_target_name>
	PUBLIC Simple_Vector
)
```
